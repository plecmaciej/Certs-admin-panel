This project was created as part of a technical assignment for a job interview. The task was to configure and modify an existing full-stack application (Ruby on Rails + React + Redux) according to specific requirements.

## Assignment Scope

The task aimed to evaluate the following skills:

- Setting up and configuring the development environment independently
- Creating a basic Rails API endpoint (based on an existing pattern)
- Creating a React CRUD view (based on existing components)
- Debugging and fixing frontend issues
- Familiarity with React, Redux, and Rails

### Required Functionalities

- Display a list view of certificates (representing courses completed by a user)
- Implement full CRUD operations for certificates:
  - Fields: `name` (text), `description` (textarea), and `user` (select dropdown)
- Fix a bug: After login, the user should be redirected to the users page (currently remains on login page but top menu is shown)
- Add a new menu item `Terms` that opens a modal with Terms & Conditions content (using Redux)
